<h1>In this course,</h1> We will be covering the entire full stack web development, enabling each one of you to build an entire right website right form scratch.
<br>
We have several sections in our course and each section is organized based on the specific item
<br>
We shall begin the discussion by knowing the front end web technologies which includes
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and JQUERY
<br>
Then, we would teach PYTHON, DJANGO and SEQUEL that are required for the backend Web Development of the web applications.
<br>
Once we have mastered both front end and backend web technologies, we shall build some web applications.
<br>
Each section of our course has challenge tasks and some certain assignments for your practice purpose.
<br>
Now, let's get to know about the course and the syllabus
<br>
SYLLABUS:
HTML
CSS
BOOTSTRAP
JAVASCRIPT
DOM
jQuery
Python

Sample Website Development
<br>
Before we proceed any further, we have to download and install some software's.
The software's we will be using in our entire program are as follows
1. Text Editor - ATOM TEXT EDITOR (OR) SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR (OR) VS CODE.
2. Web Browser - GOOGLE CHROME (OR) MOZILLA FIREFOX.
3. Anaconda Distribution - For creating virtual environments.
<br>
You can download and install sublime text editor from its official website givem below:
https://www.sublimetext.com
<br>
Once, you complete the above two steps, open the code you want to run and right click to see an option called open in browser.

<br>
Select that option to display your code result in your default browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we have successfully downloaded and installed atom and google, let's proceed our discussion further.
Use any off the text editor and web browser of your choice.<br>
Even before we talk about web development, its timme for same general basic questions 
<br>
<em>What is the web?</em>
The World Wide Web, commonly known as th Web, is an information system Where documents and other web resource are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
<br><br>
<em>Why we use web?</em>
Web sefvices are a way to expose a functionality of your website to the outside world so that other applications can use it. Moreover, If you want some data from your web site to be visible to other devices like android or iOS then you can expose this data using web services and it can be consumend in android or iOS or Windows or any other platform fr that matter.
<br>
<em>How to develop website?</em><br>
Create a file for each page of the website using HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) that gives the content of the page . To do this, you will typically pay an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for web Hosting, and move your files to their server using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

<br>
<em>Who invented website?</em>
Tim Berners-Lee<br>
The first web page went live on August 6, 1991. It was dedicated to information on the World Wide Web project and was made by Tim Berners-Lee. It ran on a NeXT computer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html .
<br>

Now lets answer another intresting question <br>
How does the web work? <br>
So imagine what happens when you open your browser and try to visit a website?<br>
Let's breakdown the basic steps! <br>
Step 1:<br>
Usually one would type the URL of the website inside a default web browser to visit it.
www.selflearnwithus.com  
<br>
Step 2:<br>
Your local machine sends a request in form of a packets, which has the IP('Internet Protocol') address of the website you wantt to visit.<br>

www.selflearnwithus.com <br>
IP 123.456.789.10  ==>

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/HTTP_RequestMessage.png?raw=true)

<br>

Step 3:<br>
Then a computer generally sends this request using wires using your ISP (Internet Service Provider).<br>

Step 4:<br>
Your ISp re-routes this request to the corresponding server location, using IP address as a guide.<br>

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/server_responce.png?raw=true)<br>

<em>What is the server?</em><br>
Generally a server  is a device that provides seervices to other devices.<br>
In other words, devixes will request access to an HTML file form our server, and our serrver will return the HTML file to that device.<br>

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/server.jpeg?raw=true)<br>

You might ghave seen the above picture of server in movies.<br>

<br>

Simple way to understand<br>
<em>What is the server?</em><br>
A server is a device that will accept the request and send back the responce to the user.<br>
<br>

Step 5:<br>
Once your request reaches the server, it can now send back the website you asked for.<br>
<br>

Step 6:<br>
But generally a complete website with so much content is very big in size to send as a single packet of data which is a problem.<br>
<br>

Step 7:<br>
To resolve this issue, the server will send back the website which is divided into many small packets of data.<br>
<br>

Step 8:<br>
These packets come with certain instrictions on how to get back to requested end user adn finally reassembles to display the website.<br>
<br>

Step 9:
These packets don't mind what path they follow to reach the final end user, but their objective is just reach the final location of request made.

![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/packet-switching.png?raw=true)<br>

Step 10:<br>
Once these packets reach the final end user, they are reassembled to show the requested web page in correct formate.<br>
<br>

Step 11:<br>
All of this process happens at speed off light (29 979 2458 m/s) 3Ã—10<sup>8</sup> m/s, so it happens extremely faster.<br>
<br>
<br>

Let's continue our discussion further by conversing what is ment is "Full-Stack"<br>
<br>
So, mainly there are two main components of any website <br>
1. The Front-End <br>
2. The Back-End <br>
3. Database Management <br>

<br>

The Front-End is what one sees as a final end user on the website.
<br>
The Back-End uses technology to display content on the Front-End.

<br><br>

The Front-End revolves around the following technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. Bootrtrap

<br>
Now let's start discussing the above technologies one by one.
<br>

First let's start our session by talking about HTML.<br>
<br>
![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/HTML.png?raw=true)<br>

~ HTML stands for - Hypertext Markup Language <br>
~ Every website will have HTML, it is the general structure of a page.<br>
~ HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.<br>
~ "Hypertext" refers to links that connect webpages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.<br>
~ Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other peole, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.<br>
~ That's a brief introduction about HTML<br>
<br>
<br>

Now, let's talk about the next lenguage CSS
![alt text](https://github.com/mouse-rider/Full_Stack_Web_Development/blob/main/image/CSS3.png?raw=true)<br>

~ CSS stands for - Cascading Style Sheets<br>
~ CSS is the actual styling of website.(Most website have it)<br>
~ But even without CSS we can develop basic web apps but they wont look appealing.<br>
~ Colors, fonts, borders, and many more are all defined by CSS.<br>
~ CSS is not mandatory to have, but mostly all sites have it.<br> 
~ That is a brief introduction about CSS.<br>
<br>
