In this course, we will be covering the entire full stack web development, enabling each one of you to build an entire right website right form scratch.

We have several sections in our course and each section is organized based on the specific item

We shall begin the discussion by knowing the front end web technologies which includes
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and JQUERY

Then, we would teach PYTHON, DJANGO and SEQUEL that are required for the backend Web Development of the web applications.

Once we have mastered both front end and backend web technologies, we shall build some web applications.

Each section of our course has challenge tasks and some certain assignments for your practice purpose.

Now, let's get to know about the course and the syllabus

Before we proceed any further, we have to download and install some software's.
The software's we will be using in our entire program are as follows
1. Text Editor - ATOM TEXT EDITOR (OR) SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR (OR) VS CODE.
2. Web Browser - GOOGLE CHROME (OR) MOZILLA FIREFOX.
3. Anaconda Distribution - For creating virtual environments.

You can download and install sublime text editor from its official website givem below:
https://www.sublimetext.com

Once, you complete the above two steps, open the code you want to run and right click to see an option called open in browser.

Select that option to display your code result in your default browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we have successfully downloaded and installed atom and google, let's proceed our discussion further.
Use any off the text editor and web browser of your choice.
Even before we talk about web development, its timme for same general basic questions 

What is the web?
The World Wide Web, commonly known as th Web, is an information system Where documents and other web resource are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.

Why we use web?
Web sefvices are a way to expose a functionality of your website to the outside world so that other applications can use it. Moreover, If you want some data from your web site to be visible to other devices like android or iOS then you can expose this data using web services and it can be consumend in android or iOS or Windows or any other platform fr that matter.

How to develop website?
Create a file for each page of the website using HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) that gives the content of the page . To do this, you will typically pay an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for web Hosting, and move your files to their server using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

who invented website?
Tim Berners-Lee
The first web page went live on August 6, 1991. It was dedicated to information on the World Wide Web project and was made by Tim Berners-Lee. It ran on a NeXT computer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html .

Now lets answer another intresting question
How does the web work?
So imagine what happens when you open your browser and try to visit a website?
Let's breakdown the basic steps!
Step 1:
Usually one would type the URL of the website inside a default web browser to visit it.
www.selflearnwithus.com
Step 2:
Your local machine sends a request in form of a packets, which has the IP('Internet Protocol') address of the website you wantt to visit.
